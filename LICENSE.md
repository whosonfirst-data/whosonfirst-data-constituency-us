# whosonfirst-data

Who's On First is a gazetteer of places. Not quite _all_ the places in the world but a whole lot of them and, we hope, the kinds of places that we mostly share in common.

A gazetteer is a big list of places, each with a stable identifier and some number of descriptive properties about that location. An interesting way to think about a gazetteer is to consider it as the space where debate about a place is _managed_ but not decided. We call our gazetteer "Who's On First" (or sometimes "WOF" for short).

The Who's On First dataset is both original work and a modification of existing open data. Some of those open data projects **do** require attribution. We have listed all sources below. 

When we [source](https://github.com/whosonfirst/whosonfirst-sources/) other open data projects we make best effort to indicate them (e.g.: `'src:geom':naturalearth`) and we also include the original source's properties prefixed with the following names spaces: 

* `gn` - [GeoNames](http://www.geonames.org) (CC-BY)
* `gp` - [GeoPlanet](https://developer.yahoo.com/geo/geoplanet/) Where on Earth, aka `woe` (CC-BY)
* `ne` - [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com) (Public Domain)
* `oa` - [OurAirports](http://ourairports.com/) (Public Domain)
* `qs` - [Quattroshapes](https://github.com/foursquare/quattroshapes/blob/master/) (CC-BY)
* `zs` - [Zetashapes](http://zetashapes.com/) (CC-BY)

Please notify us if you believe that an open data project has not been properly noted.

Our original work is generaly indicated with properties prefixed with `wof` or is not prefixed (like `name`). 

Remember, some sources **require attribution**, some do not. Mapzen's original work, including the format and structure that allows Who's On First to operate, is made available under the [Creative Commons Zero](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) designation, and a shout out would be lovely.


## Sources

Who's On First makes use of a number of open data sources, some of whom **do** require attribution. Please note that original sources may be modified.

### GeoNames

Properties with the `gn` prefix are from GeoNames.

**Examples:** `gn:id` for GeoNames identifier concordance, and `src:centroid_lbl:geonames` indicate the source of our label centroid is GeoNames.

GeoNames database is licenced as follows:

```
The GeoNames geographical database is available for download free of
charge under a creative commons attribution license. 
```

More details can be found at: http://www.geonames.org/about.html

### GeoPlanet

Properties with the `gp` prefix are from GeoPlanet. 

Sometimes the `woe` prefix is used instead because GeoPlanet supersedes Where on Earth (WOE) and not all data has been updated.

**Examples:** `gp:id` for GeoPlanet identifier concordance, and localized names (eg: `name:chi_p`, `name:ger_p`, and `name:kor_p`).

### Natural Earth

Properties with the `ne` prefix are from Natural Earth.

**Example:** `ne:name` for the Natural Earth feature name.


Natural Earth is released as follows:

```
All versions of Natural Earth raster + vector map data found on this
website are in the public domain. You may use the maps in any manner,
including modifying the content and design, electronic dissemination,

### OurAirports

Properties with the `oa` prefix are from OurAirports.

**Example:** `oa:elevation_ft` for the elevation in feet.

OurAirports files are released as follows:

```
We hereby release all of these files into the Public Domain, with no
warranty of any kind — By downloading any of these files, you agree
that OurAirports.com, Megginson Technologies Ltd., and anyone involved

drowsiness that persists more than two days.
```

### Quattroshapes

Properties with the `qs` prefix are from Quattroshapes.

**Examples:** `qs:id` for Quattroshapes identifier concordance and `qs:adm0` for country names. 

Who's on First doesn't always use the Quattroshapes geometry, so review that in `src:geom`. When we do, some Quattroshapes features source from friendly CC0 or Public Domain licensed projects, and others from a stricter CC-BY project: check that in the `qs_source` property. For example, `qs_source:EuroGlobalMap` means you'll need to give specific credit to one or more European national mapping agencies as further described below.

Quattroshapes are licensed as follows:

```
The quattroshapes are released by foursquare under CC-BY attribution
license.

Please include attribution in your app, site, or printed work. Sample
wording: "Includes data from foursquare quattroshapes" with a link to

### Zetashapes

Properties with the `zs` prefix are from Zetashapes.

**Examples:** If we source our default geometry from Zetashapes we say that in `src:geom: zetashapes`. We list which US Census Blocks compose the Zetashapes geometry in `zs:blockids`, and a few other properties like `zs:pop10` for population count.

Zetashapes polygons and data are subject to the following:

```
The polygons generated by this site do not have any added restrictions
beyond the base data from TIGER and Flickr.

By submitting votes to this site you are agreeing that your votes will
be public and in the public domain.

The basic source data is from US TIGER/Line Census Data which is
public domain (Q10). This site also makes use of data scraped from the
flickr api -- you should probably mention on your site if you reuse
this data that there is flickr data associated with it.
